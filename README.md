### Purpose and goal of the project
---
Soley to practice skills learned in SQL, Python and data visualization.

I had asked ChatGPT 4 to make me a project prompt, but after some thinking I realized that I didn't
want to do what it had originally had me do and analyze product sales data, as that is not very intrinsically interesting to me.
I then thought that a great thing for me to do would be to analyze Spotify data, as someone that already loves and adores Spotify
this makes perfect sense! So I had ChatGPT rewrite the prompt to accomodate for this change.

#### ChatGPT
ChatGPT was instrumental in doing this project. I did my best to do everything on my own. But I didn't let that stop me from using ChatGPT to accelerate the process of development of this project. Every time I asked ChatGPT a question I learned something new, not just the answer to a question that I had, but also I learned new ways of doing things, and gained new understandings of how certain things operate.

## Basic data checks and moving data into a sqlite3 database
Starting with './data/raw_spotify_charts_data.csv'.
Check the data for null values, convert some columns to data types, and then put the csv turned dataframe into a sqlite3 database file.

After moving the dataframe into a sqlite3 database soley for the ability to practice using sql, and then doing basic checks to ensure that the database trasferred over fine.

#### Data preprocessing and cleaning
Data preprocessing and cleaning for this dataset was very minimal, where only one column had problematic values.

## Data visualization and exploration
My goal here is to better understand the data in terms of popularity, like what genres are more prevelant or what artists have the most listens etc.

There were 5 different questions I posed on the data.
1. How many streams were there per country?
2. How many songs were there per country?
3. How do artists compare their number of streams to the number of songs that they have?
4. What are the cumulative trends in streams?
5. What are the cumulative trends in songs?

#### The data
The dataset that I worked with contained only songs that were in the top charts of spotify, so the results are not totally complete and an accurate representation of anything but of what makes a hit song.

#### My approach was not perfect
The questions I asked of the data here may not be the 'best' questions to ask, nor may have I asked them in the best way, meaning that I did not take the data into my notebook and provide an answer the best way through my code and data transformation. But this is merely a repitition in my exercization of my data analytics skills, and I do want to complete it and not spend too much time working with this data.

#### What I learned
It is really hard to tell what I actually learned here, as there are questions you can ask and wonder that make the data seem very incomplete. For example, this data is only 4 years of the entirety of the operations of Spotify as a company. One insight that I learned of was that Spotify is used less in areas like Africa, and the middle east, and is obviously more prevalent in places like western Europe and North America. There is however a large increase in listeners and creators in Latin America.

Overall insights were not very valuable or insightful, but that's okay, that is not exactly what this project is for.

## What I learned, technically with using Python and SQL
The tools I primarly used are as follows:
* **Pandas**:
    * I used pandas a lot in this project with almost no difficulty. It did what I wanted it to do pretty much the whole time. There was not a lot of evolution in my Pandas skills.
* **Seaborn**:
    * I spent a lot of time with seaborn trying to get plots to behave and look the way that I wanted them to. I found that in the beginning I did not have the clearest direction as to what I wanted to do with seaborn, but once I realized this issue was holding me back, I looked at my data and asked a question, like how do streams of different regions compare to others? Once I had a clear question, I only needed to follow through, and guide myself to the answer.
* **Jupyter notebooks**:
    * The entire project was done in jupyter notebooks. Not much learned here, jupyter notebooks are pretty simple and straight forward.
* **SQLite3**:
    * I spent a lot of time tinkering with and tweaking SQL queries to get the data I wanted and in the way that I wanted it. There were times where I used SQL that were pretty complicated, especially for me. I've done more with SQL and in more ways than I ever have in this project. One of the more complicated queries where I compile a cumulative sum of all stream data over the course of 2017-2021 was one of if not the most complicated query that I have ever written in SQL. My SQL abilities are far better than they ever have been as a result of this project.

Special thank you to my mentor `Logapriya Viswanathan`.
